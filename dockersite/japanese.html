    <p class="h4 pt-3 pb-1">All Katakana quiz</p>
    <p class="lead pt-2">Date of entry - 2021/5/20 </p>
    <p class="fw-normal py-4 text-break text-wrap lh-lg mx-3">Well, you know the drill at this point. This is the ALL katakana quiz, which refers to all of the characters (excluding special characters).  Of course, this was to test our abilities for katakana. Now, for this one, there isn't much. I basically learned the rest of the characters left, so that was what it was trying to prove. I will admit that I didn't get much time to study for it since I had a backlog of assignments and projects, and the Tokyo OPA + Letter to Saijo V2 project to do. And just to add to that, I was also practicing the Quizlet as well. So in the end, I barely got any time to work on this. But I did manage to go through it after a couple of tries. I did pause during some parts, but that was me trying to think how to write the characters out. Overall, I wouldn't say it's perfect, but it's not bad for the level of work that I have done so far. There weren't any struggles except that part where I struggled at. This whole experience was a really fun one. I've always wanted to learn Japanese since I was in middle school, and it's like my dreams finally becoming true. I may be a beginner, but this is the path you have to take in order to be better.  This is the path in order to become better. I technically don't need to write this one, but I'm doing it since I want to keep a record of what I have been doing all this time. But this is going to be the last entry when it comes to the digital portfolio. Maybe forever, but maybe for a few months as well. who knows? But this has been an adventure. I hope you people best and see you soon...

    <p class="h4 pt-3 pb-1">Letter to Saijo V2</p>
    <p class="lead pt-2">Date of entry - 2021/5/16 </p>
    <p class="fw-normal py-4 text-break text-wrap lh-lg mx-3">This one is about the Letter to Saijo V2. Well, this is kinda the same thing with the first one but this time, instead of introducing ourselves and writing about our daily lives, we introduce them to areas in San Francisco that they might want to visit and our opinions on them. We were also going to introduce what we wanted to do in Tokyo and to ask some "touristy" questions about Saijo. Now this one, we had to draw a map of SF with the places labeled as well. That took around a total of 4-6 hours to complete, and the Japanese portion took 6 hours to complete. The rest took another 4 hours to complete. So I ended up spending well over 16+ hours working on this thing in total. The preparation of the map was done earlier but still counts as the overall work as well. It's the same steps as last time, but we knew the names of the people who are our "penpal" letters. They will be writing back a letter for us to read soon. Now I don't know how long it would take, but I hope we are able to receive them since that is something that I wanted to do. To read the letters they sent us back. This one assumes that you had already read the last one, so there is no need to keep on sharing digital portfolio links and domains again. This one took a long time to do. And I didn't struggle as much as before. Maybe it's because that I have been doing this for almost a year? Who knows... But what is important is that I started to get used to this structure and how it works. It's somewhat basic, but I did go in-depth with this one. I spent hours writing and thinking about how to put this together. Taking time out of my sleep just so I can add these small details. I worked to great lengths on this one, and really put my soul into this. This one might be the last one for this class, so I wanted to make this one a special one.  And indeed this one is. There were a couple of mistakes, but those could be easily correct. The hardest part is the map of SF. Since I did this digitally, my drawing pen was having some issues regarding the pointer, so the lines were not as smooth as I would want them to be. So for the smooth lines, I had to switch to using my mouse for it. But that was the only struggle that I had with this one. And it was more or less the same length as the first one. Now, this pandemic has kinda screwed us all. This pandemic has been hard on everyone, including me. 500,000 deaths in the US, and over 3 million countings worldwide. We were forced to do this digitally citing covid risks. And it hasn't been easy to learn about this. Every single class, I spent time and effort on working and learning this. This has been a language that I've wanted to learn for years. And now here's the chance. I have meant with some people from japan a while ago in a program, but this one is kinda like one-on-one with my penpal. And this pandemic made it a lot harder to learn. Without showing it in person, things have been a lot harder to get ahold of.  And this is mostly true for everyone at one point. And I know this has been hard on the teachers as well.  And I'll repeat this: even though I'm a beginner language learner, this is the start. This is the start of countless dreams and possibilities. This is it. And I thought to myself: since we are closing this semester soon, I better make use of this. And so I did. I practiced the quizlets as a part of my may challenge, and constantly spent time grinding away on this one. I forced myself to work late nights, and to the point where I was only getting 3-5 hours of sleep daily. I forced myself to work so hard on this. And the effort is working. I'm finally seeing progress.  This may be the start, but it is the foundation that everything else is going to be built on. Next time, I would have continued to work even harder, and even harder. The last entry for this semester is going to be the all katakana quiz. And that's going to be it. I'm still working on improving this site as much as I can, but that might be the last one for a while...

  <p class="h4 pt-3 pb-1">Tokyo OPA</p> 
  <p class="lead pt-2">Date of entry - 2021/5/4</p>
  <p class="fw-normal py-4 text-break text-wrap lh-lg mx-5">Well, this format kinda is different, due to the way how adobe spark wanted me to embed the HTML code into it. And there's nothing I can do about it. But anyway, this assignment. This is the Tokyo OPA assignment, in which we are supposed to provide some images about places in Tokyo that we want to visit one day, and say stuff like the name, what type of place is it, and all of the other stuff like opinions as well. Honestly, I would say I didn't do that bad. I mean, the last one had a little bit of mistakes, but most of them were very clean and easy to follow. I wouldn't say it's perfect, but it's near-perfect for me. The last one was something about a restaurant. I chose the Ramen Atelier Nakiryū (創作麺工房 鳴龍). But for the video, I put it as Nakiryū to make it a lot easier. From what I gathered, it's one of the Michelin star restaurants. That means it's pretty expensive, but you know it has to be very very good as well.  Honestly, there wasn't anything setting me back. Some of the pronunciations were a little bit hard, but with a  little bit of practice, I managed to get through. But most of them weren't even that hard. Compared with the Shibuya project (which took like 12+ hours in total), this one only took 1-2 hours. And not to mention that I never really did much practice except in class.  Compared with the first project, this is really a massive improvement. Though this is just the basics of Japanese, there is still much to come. Reflecting back to the Nihon I know video, that one was me just basically struggling to put even the most basic of sentences together. And this one was just me speaking very fluently about the stuff that I wanted to do in Tokyo.  As we are closing this semester in less than a month, it's been a lifetime dream of learning Japanese. I remembered before COVID-19 started, I was one of the early ones to get called in for the class schedules next year. And somehow I managed to get in.  This whole year has been basically turned upside-down because of COVID-19. But anyway, this will be something that I would go on and look at later. There is so much that I can do, like more practice, and having a real one-on-one conversation with something like my teacher in Japanese. But this is only the start of a very very long journey. Learning a new skill and getting good at it takes years of dedication, and support to do it. For example, I’ve been playing piano for 11 years at this point. And I still haven't given up yet. And this applies to learning a new skill. Yes, you may feel like you want to give up, but in the end, it's all going to be worth it. You will see the light at the end of the tunnel one day... </p>

    <p class="h4 pt-3 pb-1">Letter to Saijo</p>
      <p class="lead pt-2">Date of entry - 2021/4/7</p>
      <p class="fw-normal py-4 text-break text-wrap lh-lg mx-3">This one is quite special since this is a digital letter to the students in one of the high schools in Saijo. The idea was to write a letter (both in Japanese and in English), and to kinda explain things like some basic info, what we usually do in a day, and other stuff. We first do it on google drawings and convert it to a pdf file. From there, we just give it to the teacher, and by April 5th, the teacher will send them all to the other teachers in Saijo, and they will print it out. And they will give it to the students. As of writing this, it's already 2 days past the due date, so I hope they already have read the letter and checked on this digital portfolio. The QR code just goes to this digital portfolio. Now, this was a fun experience and project to work on, since I already have gotten to interact with some of the students from that high school in Saijo.  And I know that they are going to see this digital portfolio once they scanned it. Originally, I had gotten a custom domain **<a href="http://exingcn.com">http://exingcn.com</a>, and made a version on my other accounts to add in the DNS records the domain, but I switched it to this digital portfolio last minute. This one is mainly for teachers and students to see, the other one is meant for more for family members, and the public to see. This project wasn't that challenging to work on, but I had a hard time getting started on the Japanese part of it. Until I managed to get it done by 2 am PST. The Japanese portion was the most difficult to work on, and I will admit there is a couple of mistake in there, but it just shows you that I’m learning and I make mistakes a lot. And that part took the longest to work on. The rest was easy to work on since the English portion only took around an hour to finish. Now, you may be asking: why are there 2 pages? There's only supposed to be one. Well, we were allowed 2 pages, if our letters were very long, just like mine. I had planned it where you would need both letters side by side in order to fully understand it. I added some captions, and some other stuff just for fun, and mostly covered the info from the Japanese part. But I also added a lot more, so it looks like an essay now. This project was the most exciting and fun to work on since I knew that the students from Saijo would be reading this. If you are reading this, I hope you enjoyed looking at the letter and my digital portfolio. I spent a lot of time working on this project.

        Well, another month has passed. And that means another challenge, and in this case, it's the March Challenge. This one is a little bit different, and we had to choose between 3 sets. This one was mainly focused on learning about different fruits and vegetables. I choose set B, where we had to write and list the fruits that we wanted to learn about in katakana and write about whether we liked them or not. We had to write out which fruits our family members liked and disliked. And the rest was mainly practice. (on the left, you can see some of the stuff that I wrote and practiced with) Well, just like last time, I didn’t have much time to commit to practicing this, but now I do have a lot more time. The rest of the time I have will be going to learning Japanese and putting my best effort into it. There was a massive growth if you look at the graph on the left. Compared to last month's monthly challenge, this is a big improvement. There were a few fruits that had some kanji in them, and that made it challenging to try and memorize. But a lot of them were the easy ones, that only had katakana on them. And that made it a memorable one since now I can tell someone what types of fruits I like in Japanese. This could be useful to introduce myself and to have some fun with my family. As I do more of these challenges, I start to realize the purpose of them: to challenge and get outside of your comfort zone. And this could be applied to a lot of things. Like life itself. You won't learn unless you put yourself outside your comfort zone. I will always remember this motto: Seek Discomfort. This comes from Yes Theory, and their videos have truly made me push myself outside my comfort zone. If it weren't for that moto, I would have chosen something easier.  As I’m still learning this language, the most important thing that I learned is to step outside your comfort zone and to practice. Just like learning how to code or how to play an instrument, you won't learn unless you put yourself outside your comfort zone. That is something to truly ponder on...
