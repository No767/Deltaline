          This one is about the Letter to Saijo V2. Well, this is kinda the same
          thing with the first one but this time, instead of introducing
          ourselves and writing about our daily lives, we introduce them to
          areas in San Francisco that they might want to visit and our opinions
          on them. We were also going to introduce what we wanted to do in Tokyo
          and to ask some &quot;touristy&quot; questions about Saijo. Now this
          one, we had to draw a map of SF with the places labeled as well. That
          took around a total of 4-6 hours to complete, and the Japanese portion
          took 6 hours to complete. The rest took another 4 hours to complete.
          So I ended up spending well over 16+ hours working on this thing in
          total. The preparation of the map was done earlier but still counts as
          the overall work as well. It&apos;s the same steps as last time, but
          we knew the names of the people who are our &quot;penpal&quot;
          letters. They will be writing back a letter for us to read soon. Now I
          don&apos;t know how long it would take, but I hope we are able to
          receive them since that is something that I wanted to do. To read the
          letters they sent us back. This one assumes that you had already read
          the last one, so there is no need to keep on sharing digital portfolio
          links and domains again. This one took a long time to do. And I
          didn&apos;t struggle as much as before. Maybe it&apos;s because that I
          have been doing this for almost a year? Who knows... But what is
          important is that I started to get used to this structure and how it
          works. It&apos;s somewhat basic, but I did go in-depth with this one.
          I spent hours writing and thinking about how to put this together.
          Taking time out of my sleep just so I can add these small details. I
          worked to great lengths on this one, and really put my soul into this.
          This one might be the last one for this class, so I wanted to make
          this one a special one. And indeed this one is. There were a couple of
          mistakes, but those could be easily correct. The hardest part is the
          map of SF. Since I did this digitally, my drawing pen was having some
          issues regarding the pointer, so the lines were not as smooth as I
          would want them to be. So for the smooth lines, I had to switch to
          using my mouse for it. But that was the only struggle that I had with
          this one. And it was more or less the same length as the first one.
          Now, this pandemic has kinda screwed us all. This pandemic has been
          hard on everyone, including me. 500,000 deaths in the US, and over 3
          million countings worldwide. We were forced to do this digitally
          citing covid risks. And it hasn&apos;t been easy to learn about this.
          Every single class, I spent time and effort on working and learning
          this. This has been a language that I&apos;ve wanted to learn for
          years. And now here&apos;s the chance. I have meant with some people
          from japan a while ago in a program, but this one is kinda like
          one-on-one with my penpal. And this pandemic made it a lot harder to
          learn. Without showing it in person, things have been a lot harder to
          get ahold of. And this is mostly true for everyone at one point. And I
          know this has been hard on the teachers as well. And I&apos;ll repeat
          this: even though I&apos;m a beginner language learner, this is the
          start. This is the start of countless dreams and possibilities. This
          is it. And I thought to myself: since we are closing this semester
          soon, I better make use of this. And so I did. I practiced the
          quizlets as a part of my may challenge, and constantly spent time
          grinding away on this one. I forced myself to work late nights, and to
          the point where I was only getting 3-5 hours of sleep daily. I forced
          myself to work so hard on this. And the effort is working. I&apos;m
          finally seeing progress. This may be the start, but it is the
          foundation that everything else is going to be built on. Next time, I
          would have continued to work even harder, and even harder. The last
          entry for this semester is going to be the all katakana quiz. And
          that&apos;s going to be it. I&apos;m still working on improving this
          site as much as I can, but that might be the last one for a while...
