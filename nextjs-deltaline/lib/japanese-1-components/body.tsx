          This one is about the Letter to Saijo V2. Well, this is kinda the same
          thing with the first one but this time, instead of introducing
          ourselves and writing about our daily lives, we introduce them to
          areas in San Francisco that they might want to visit and our opinions
          on them. We were also going to introduce what we wanted to do in Tokyo
          and to ask some &quot;touristy&quot; questions about Saijo. Now this
          one, we had to draw a map of SF with the places labeled as well. That
          took around a total of 4-6 hours to complete, and the Japanese portion
          took 6 hours to complete. The rest took another 4 hours to complete.
          So I ended up spending well over 16+ hours working on this thing in
          total. The preparation of the map was done earlier but still counts as
          the overall work as well. It&apos;s the same steps as last time, but
          we knew the names of the people who are our &quot;penpal&quot;
          letters. They will be writing back a letter for us to read soon. Now I
          don&apos;t know how long it would take, but I hope we are able to
          receive them since that is something that I wanted to do. To read the
          letters they sent us back. This one assumes that you had already read
          the last one, so there is no need to keep on sharing digital portfolio
          links and domains again. This one took a long time to do. And I
          didn&apos;t struggle as much as before. Maybe it&apos;s because that I
          have been doing this for almost a year? Who knows... But what is
          important is that I started to get used to this structure and how it
          works. It&apos;s somewhat basic, but I did go in-depth with this one.
          I spent hours writing and thinking about how to put this together.
          Taking time out of my sleep just so I can add these small details. I
          worked to great lengths on this one, and really put my soul into this.
          This one might be the last one for this class, so I wanted to make
          this one a special one. And indeed this one is. There were a couple of
          mistakes, but those could be easily correct. The hardest part is the
          map of SF. Since I did this digitally, my drawing pen was having some
          issues regarding the pointer, so the lines were not as smooth as I
          would want them to be. So for the smooth lines, I had to switch to
          using my mouse for it. But that was the only struggle that I had with
          this one. And it was more or less the same length as the first one.
          Now, this pandemic has kinda screwed us all. This pandemic has been
          hard on everyone, including me. 500,000 deaths in the US, and over 3
          million countings worldwide. We were forced to do this digitally
          citing covid risks. And it hasn&apos;t been easy to learn about this.
          Every single class, I spent time and effort on working and learning
          this. This has been a language that I&apos;ve wanted to learn for
          years. And now here&apos;s the chance. I have meant with some people
          from japan a while ago in a program, but this one is kinda like
          one-on-one with my penpal. And this pandemic made it a lot harder to
          learn. Without showing it in person, things have been a lot harder to
          get ahold of. And this is mostly true for everyone at one point. And I
          know this has been hard on the teachers as well. And I&apos;ll repeat
          this: even though I&apos;m a beginner language learner, this is the
          start. This is the start of countless dreams and possibilities. This
          is it. And I thought to myself: since we are closing this semester
          soon, I better make use of this. And so I did. I practiced the
          quizlets as a part of my may challenge, and constantly spent time
          grinding away on this one. I forced myself to work late nights, and to
          the point where I was only getting 3-5 hours of sleep daily. I forced
          myself to work so hard on this. And the effort is working. I&apos;m
          finally seeing progress. This may be the start, but it is the
          foundation that everything else is going to be built on. Next time, I
          would have continued to work even harder, and even harder. The last
          entry for this semester is going to be the all katakana quiz. And
          that&apos;s going to be it. I&apos;m still working on improving this
          site as much as I can, but that might be the last one for a while...

          Well, this format kinda is different, due to the way how adobe spark
          wanted me to embed the HTML code into it. And there&apos;s nothing I
          can do about it. But anyway, this assignment. This is the Tokyo OPA
          assignment, in which we are supposed to provide some images about
          places in Tokyo that we want to visit one day, and say stuff like the
          name, what type of place is it, and all of the other stuff like
          opinions as well. Honestly, I would say I didn&apos;t do that bad. I
          mean, the last one had a little bit of mistakes, but most of them were
          very clean and easy to follow. I wouldn&apos;t say it&apos;s perfect,
          but it&apos;s near-perfect for me. The last one was something about a
          restaurant. I chose the Ramen Atelier Nakiryū (創作麺工房 鳴龍). But
          for the video, I put it as Nakiryū to make it a lot easier. From what
          I gathered, it&apos;s one of the Michelin star restaurants. That means
          it&apos;s pretty expensive, but you know it has to be very very good
          as well. Honestly, there wasn&apos;t anything setting me back. Some of
          the pronunciations were a little bit hard, but with a little bit of
          practice, I managed to get through. But most of them weren&apos;t even
          that hard. Compared with the Shibuya project (which took like 12+
          hours in total), this one only took 1-2 hours. And not to mention that
          I never really did much practice except in class. Compared with the
          first project, this is really a massive improvement. Though this is
          just the basics of Japanese, there is still much to come. Reflecting
          back to the Nihon I know video, that one was me just basically
          struggling to put even the most basic of sentences together. And this
          one was just me speaking very fluently about the stuff that I wanted
          to do in Tokyo. As we are closing this semester in less than a month,
          it&apos;s been a lifetime dream of learning Japanese. I remembered
          before COVID-19 started, I was one of the early ones to get called in
          for the class schedules next year. And somehow I managed to get in.
          This whole year has been basically turned upside-down because of
          COVID-19. But anyway, this will be something that I would go on and
          look at later. There is so much that I can do, like more practice, and
          having a real one-on-one conversation with something like my teacher
          in Japanese. But this is only the start of a very very long journey.
          Learning a new skill and getting good at it takes years of dedication,
          and support to do it. For example, I&apos;ve been playing piano for 11
          years at this point. And I still haven&apos;t given up yet. And this
          applies to learning a new skill. Yes, you may feel like you want to
          give up, but in the end, it&apos;s all going to be worth it. You will
          see the light at the end of the tunnel one day...

          This one is quite special since this is a digital letter to the
          students in one of the high schools in Saijo. The idea was to write a
          letter (both in Japanese and in English), and to kinda explain things
          like some basic info, what we usually do in a day, and other stuff. We
          first do it on google drawings and convert it to a pdf file. From
          there, we just give it to the teacher, and by April 5th, the teacher
          will send them all to the other teachers in Saijo, and they will print
          it out. And they will give it to the students. As of writing this,
          it&apos;s already 2 days past the due date, so I hope they already
          have read the letter and checked on this digital portfolio. The QR
          code just goes to this digital portfolio. Now, this was a fun
          experience and project to work on, since I already have gotten to
          interact with some of the students from that high school in Saijo. And
          I know that they are going to see this digital portfolio once they
          scanned it. Originally, I had gotten a custom domain, and made a
          version on my other accounts to add in the DNS records the domain, but
          I switched it to this digital portfolio last minute. This one is
          mainly for teachers and students to see, the other one is meant for
          more for family members, and the public to see. This project
          wasn&apos;t that challenging to work on, but I had a hard time getting
          started on the Japanese part of it. Until I managed to get it done by
          2 am PST. The Japanese portion was the most difficult to work on, and
          I will admit there is a couple of mistake in there, but it just shows
          you that I&apos;m learning and I make mistakes a lot. And that part
          took the longest to work on. The rest was easy to work on since the
          English portion only took around an hour to finish. Now, you may be
          asking: why are there 2 pages? There&apos;s only supposed to be one.
          Well, we were allowed 2 pages, if our letters were very long, just
          like mine. I had planned it where you would need both letters side by
          side in order to fully understand it. I added some captions, and some
          other stuff just for fun, and mostly covered the info from the
          Japanese part. But I also added a lot more, so it looks like an essay
          now. This project was the most exciting and fun to work on since I
          knew that the students from Saijo would be reading this. If you are
          reading this, I hope you enjoyed looking at the letter and my digital
          portfolio. I spent a lot of time working on this project.
