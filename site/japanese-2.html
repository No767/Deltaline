           As you can see here, this is an entry for the February challenge. For the goals, I had the first one, which is to review materials and practice for around 10-15 mins a day, and just more practice. The second one was to research some words that I could use to describe myself better. The third one was to memorize the katakana characters.  And the 4th one was just more practice with hiragana and katakana. Now, I will admit that I didn't get to memorize all of them, but that was due to time constraints regarding extracurricular activities. But I did make some progress though. I did take my time to actually go ahead and write these out. When I had the free time, what I did was grab a piece of paper, and write down the katakana characters each 9-10 times. The plan was to repeat it until the month ended. But because of personal time constraints, I ended up stopping halfway there. As you can see on the left of this, that's the "evidence", which is the actual thing that I used to practice with. And personally, I gave myself a 2 star for number 3. But not all effort was in vain. The teacher had provided us with resources to help us with this. And one of them was very simple books but in Japanese (with a mix of kanji w/furigana). I took the time to read some of them, and one of them was called "何が飲みますか?" (なにがのみますか?). Which the translation should be "What [type] of drink is this?". So I spent my time reading that and believe it or not, it was really easy for me to read and understand that. The second one was "いました!", which is basically a cat going to a Shinto shrine to find the same type of animal as the cat. That one wasn't that hard to read and understand, but it did give me a decent challenge to get the definitions for it. Other than that, that's pretty much it. Now, I could have done better, such as better planning and optimizing workflow, but there isn't much I can do now, since the February Challenges are supposed to be done. The plan for the March Challenges is pretty much the same: complete the rest of the katakana (if I can) and read even more of those books and articles.

                Well, as you can see here, we have another seesaw video, but this time it is about the schedule of my day (obviously it isn’t that in-depth). Now for this video, we created a basic visual presentation by making a google slides presentation and finding images that would suit us for the visual presentation. Stuff like the buses, pictures of certain subjects, and afterschool activities and stuff like that. While working on this, I didn’t find anything interesting since I already knew a lot of the subjects that I’m taking, such as math (which is Algebra 2/pre-calc), science (which is chemistry), and history (which is world history). But I did make a point to mention the teacher’s last names. But I also didn’t find anything that was interesting to me or other people. Since I already knew a lot of the information that I was about to say, there wasn’t anything new for me to find. But something I did find interesting is how foreign words are put in katakana. For example, one of the words that I was using was robotics (since I am already a part of the robotics team here at wash). In katakana, the first part “robo” (ロボ) is actually kept from the English word “Robo” (meaning automated, automatic). And the way that katakana handles the “tics” in robotics is fairly interesting as well. In katakana, it’s “tikkusu” (ティックス), which I guess sounds similar to “tics” in English. So the final word is “robotikkusu” (ロボティックス). Personally, there weren’t many challenging moments since it was okay in my opinion, but I did have issues trying to say it without having the awkward silence breaks in between words. In my opinion, it was a lot better than I expected, and especially we are only given around 20 minutes to finish this one. I mean, it’s a little bit rushed, but it does the job. Given that I’m still a beginner in Japanese, this is still to be expected. The reason why I call these parts challenging is that it took some practice in order to get some right. And even on the final run, I’m pretty sure that I got some of the words incorrect and still got some structures wrong as well. But that was probably me just rushing to get it out because I had my alg 2/pc class in like 4 minutes once I posted it on seesaw. The most important thing that I learned as a language learner is not to let your ego go too high. This certainly happened with me a lot of times, and I’m still a beginner learner, so I shouldn’t expect to be perfect and have everything figured out. I shouldn’t show off my skills and call it “perfect”. In the end, no one is perfect. We all have flaws in some way. But we can work on improving the flaws in order to make it better and to hone our skills. Personally, if I were to do this next time, I would have allowed myself to practice the day beforehand, and that way I can have a better and smoother speech at the end. But I couldn’t due to time restriction and other classes, so I will give leniency this time only.

                  Well, as you can see here on the left, this was for the "My January Challenge", where we had to work towards 4 goals for this class. And here are them as listed: 1) Able to read & write short stories in Japanese  2) Able to introduce his/her/themselves with more relevant info and accurate structures  3) Able to utilize a variety of vocabulary for the person's needs  4) Able to comprehend short messages in Japanese (become more comfortable w/ unfamiliar words). We, as you can see, my "activity" didn't really make it in terms of being able to read and write short stories in Japanese, and introducing myself with more info and accurate structures. But I was able to score at least some points on goals 3 and 4. That's because, for this month's goals, I mainly focused on writing and reading Japanese, and doing some research when it comes to kanji characters. On the left, you see some kanji characters that I learned over this past month. The first set of kanji characters is 希望, which means hope. And the second one is 水, which is water and the third one is 分, meaning "part". And the ones you see mean school and hobby. Now, my main focus for this month was more on the characters and learning how to write and read them, but I never really focused on the other goals. Now, as you can see on the drawing for the goals, I didn't focus on goals 1 and 2, and for Feb, I am going to focus on all 4 goals instead. Personally, I would say that my growth when it comes to new vocab is growing and growing, and I'm starting to comprehend short messages in Japanese. It might take a while, but these are just the first "baby steps". As we move into the next month, the new plan is to develop an activity in which I'm supposed to make some short stories using vocab that I found, and with that vocab, I'm able to introduce myself with some more info.  And the way that I'm going to do that is to look up some characters that I like and try and somehow use them in that short story. And once I feel like that short story is ready, I would share it with my teammates during the demonstration day and share it out with some of my friends and relatives. Now, it's going to be tricky to figure out how to do it, but if we take it one step at a time, we can eventually reach the point where we can be successful and use it in the real world.
